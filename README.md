This is a nascent 6502 assembler originally for use with
[ApplePy](https://github.com/jtauber/applepy). It is incomplete
but contains a couple of working samples.

The `go` script runs tests, builds a sample, and launches applepy
with suitable options to run the sample.

There is also the start of a C compiler in pycc.py, but that *doesn't*
do anything useful yet.
